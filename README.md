## About
Card Jumper is a 2D Platformer built in godot, where movement is determined with a hand of cards.

Each card is a vector, representing movement direction and speed. 
Play multiple cards at once to create a combo vector, adding an element of strategy to movement. 
Both cards and the design of the level are randomly generated, so you'll never play the same round twice. 

Race to reach the goal in the fewest moves possible. 
Collect Pickups as you go to improve your score!

This is a project for our Open Source Module COMP 7047.
